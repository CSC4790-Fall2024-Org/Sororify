Sororify is a complete, full-stack application with a React frontend, Django roles-based access, and a MongoDB database. It allows sorority Potential New Members (PNMs) to be matched with a group of sorority members based on similarity of personality, in order to maximize the strength of conversations had between PNMs and members during the Sisterhood Round of Panhellenic recruitment. PNMs and members each take a personality survey (powered by embedded SurveyJS surveys), and members of a sorority’s recruitment team will input information about how they would like members and PNMs to be matched. Then, only members of the recruitment team will be able to view the results of this matching. The access of both regular members and recruitment team members are limited by the sorority they are members of. Sororify also incorporates additional functionality that makes it an actually usable and potentially deployable application: all users’ data is stored, including survey responses, access, and matches; each user may only take the survey once, preventing duplicated entries; and a ‘super admin’ (realistically, the Panhellenic VP of Recruitment) has access to all matches, all users, and gives pin-based access to members of each sorority’s recruitment team. Sororify achieves its goal of creating the ideal matches for each sorority while maintaining security of data and ease of use.
