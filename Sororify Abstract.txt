Sororify is a complete, full-stack application with a React frontend, Django roles-based access, and a MongoDB database. It allows Potential New Members (PNMs) to be matched with a group of sorority members based on similarities, to maximize the strength of conversations between PNMs and members during the Sisterhood Round of Panhellenic recruitment. PNMs and members each provide personal information such as their major, hometown, and interests through a survey (powered by SurveyJS), and each sorority’s recruitment team will input information about how they would like members and PNMs to be matched. Then, only members of this recruitment team will be able to view the results of the matching algorithm. The access of both regular members and recruitment team members are restricted by the sorority they are members of. Sororify also incorporates additional functionality that makes it a potentially deployable application: all users’ data is stored, including survey responses and access rights; each user may only take the survey once, preventing duplicated entries; and a ‘super admin’ (Panhellenic VP of Recruitment) has the ability to designate pin-based access to members of each sorority’s recruitment team and view survey completion analytics. Sororify achieves its goal of creating the ideal matches for each sorority while maintaining security of data and ease of use.
